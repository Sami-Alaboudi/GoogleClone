## What this is: 
This is a website clone of googles search page. This page imitates googles search page and just like google homepage it integrates responsive web design.
The button functionality and search functionality on my clone do work in the exact same way, by taking in the passed search prompt and dynamically rediricting the search results, using googles actual website.
NOTE: In-line css within the .html files was used, as opposed to a seperate css file and html file format (such as with my personal website). That is why github does not list css as present in the project.

## How to run program:
All you need to run is index.html, and you will be able to see the full website clone.
